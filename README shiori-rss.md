This is a short script to add RSS feed entries into Shiori for ease of reading. 

In many cases the script should also store the cache version of a page though sometimes it may need to be manually retrieved.

The script doesn't work on pages that explicitly block scraping: it'll often create bookmarks but fail to create a cache version or capture any page metadata.
